Run 2d_odl.py and 3d_odl.py to generate the sinograms and the CT images reconstructed by FBP/FDK algorithms. It needs to install odl (https://github.com/odlgroup/odl) and astra-toolbox (https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox).
Then run test_compared_astra.m or test_astra_npy.m to test the perfomances of our method for 2d fan-beam or 3d circle cone-beam CT reconstructions.
